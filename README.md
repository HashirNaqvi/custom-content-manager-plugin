**Custom Content Manager for Small Business Websites**
**Plugin Purpose:**
This plugin will allow small business owners to easily customize key sections of their website, such as adding widgets for promotions, changing site-wide messages (e.g., holiday greetings or special offers), and attaching additional details to specific pages or posts (e.g., highlighting features, adding testimonials, etc.).

**Features Breakdown:**
**Dynamic Promotion Sidebar (Widget Area):**

Allow the admin to display promotional widgets like sales, new product launches, or upcoming events in various parts of the website (sidebar, footer, or header).
Each widget area can be customized with business-specific content, making it easy to switch promotions regularly.
Real-world use case: A bakery shop can create a widget to display their daily specials or upcoming events, which appears in a sidebar on every page of the site.

**Website Customizer - Business Info Settings:**

Through the Customizer, the admin can update business information in real-time, such as business hours, contact details, or banners for seasonal offers.
A specific setting could allow for changing header texts or a site-wide message for customers visiting the site.
Real-world use case: A salon can easily update their opening hours for holidays using the customizer without touching any code. They can also use this to change a banner for seasonal promotions, like discounts on holiday gift cards.

**Meta Boxes for Pages and Posts:
**
Add custom fields using Meta Boxes that allow the admin to attach extra information to pages or posts. For example, adding testimonials, product details, or event schedules to specific service or blog pages.
This could include fields for customer testimonials, product descriptions, or additional services on any page.
Real-world use case: A restaurant can add a special “Chef’s Recommendation” section to their blog posts or pages, showcasing dish details. Another example is adding a meta box for client testimonials on service pages.
